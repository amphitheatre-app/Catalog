# Catalog

Catalog of shared Characters

Sharing common software components in a registry streamlines development, saving
time and effort. It boosts code reuse, reduces complexity, and ensures reliable
resource management. This enhances development speed, minimizes errors, and
elevates software stability through centralized issue resolution.

## Usage

```toml
[partners]
### The `mysql` partner from the `catalog` registry.
mysql = { version = "8.0", registry = "catalog" }
```
